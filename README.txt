HEY THERE It's SUDO-HERO!

WHY TO USE THIS TOOL?

This the First Question You might yourself.Basically this programe i created for my self purpose
to divide my 4GB WordList because it was'nt opening and the time of bruteforce i didn't needed
all 4GB stuff i wanted to try alteast 1000 at once to try.So,if i found my pass in it i don't 
have to load Whole the Whole 4GB at once.


HOW IT WORKS? (Recommended to Read Before You USE)

This programe divides the file by line wise.It means at once you will be poped to enter the name
of File you want to divide.After it will ask to enter the number of total words in that each
File.If your list contains just the user name or just the password each line wise it will create
each Files of limit provided at second pop(the pop after providing the file name).And also it will
work properly if your wordlist contains username and password both in one file seperated by a blank
or a space.If suppose you entered limit 10 so each File will be of 10 username or password(or both
together).If you entered 10 and provided file contains 111 lists then the remaning 1 list will be
stored in Folder called "Divider-" as Extra.txt.The limit depends on architecture of your machine.


Key points:

Your Original File Will be as it is no change will be made to it.
